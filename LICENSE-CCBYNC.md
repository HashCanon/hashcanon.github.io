### Additional clarification (plain language)

- **No commercial exploitation of the visuals without permission.**  
  Commercial use of any visual output (including selling prints, merchandise, or minting/selling NFTs that use these mandalas) is prohibited under the **NC** clause unless written permission is obtained.

- **Secondary sales of authorized originals are allowed.**  
  You may resell or transfer an **authorized original** that you legally obtained from the creator (**DataSattva**) or from an authorized sale (for example, an NFT originally minted by the creator, or a physical print sold by the creator).  
  This permission covers **resale/transfer of that same original item**, but it does **not** grant permission to mint/create additional NFTs, prints, or merchandise based on the visuals.

The creator (**DataSattva**) retains the exclusive right to grant commercial permissions and separate commercial licenses.
